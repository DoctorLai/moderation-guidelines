#### General Rules

#### Moderation Workflow

- Go to [Review page](https://utopian.io/all/review) in Utopian.
- Click the categories you want to review.
- Pick the first unhandled post. (We encourage mods to review old posts first.)


Before reading and reviewing the post, add the contribution link to ```#i-am-on-it``` channel in our Discord Server.

**Important**: That step is required for us to prevent race condition between moderetors reviewing the same contribution. Also, before starting review on a contribution, have a look to that channel if some other moderator working on it or not.


#### Moderation Panel

There are a small set of buttons for moderator in every post.

##### 1. Hide Forever

You should do that if the contribution directly violates the rules and there is no room for any improvement about the content.

Examples:

- Fishing stories
- Cooking recipes
- Any contribution featuring closed source projects

Make sure to put a comment explaning why their contribution is not accepted.

##### 1. Pending Review

We use that button if contribution is not good enough to get an instant approval. However, if the contribution has a potential after changes and improvements from author, then we set the contribution to **pending** also inform the author about what can be done about the contribution.

**Example**

**Note**: After pending the review, make sure you edit your entry on #i-am-on-it channel in our Discord. Edit the entry includes the contribution, add a *"pending"* word to the beginning.

**Note**: Authors have 48 hours to fix/improve their posts. If they don't do anything in 48 hours, you can hide the contribution.

##### 3. Approve

If the contribution meets the criterias for an approval, just click that button. After the approval, find your entry in ```#i-am-on-it``` channel and remove it.

This channel should be clear and only store the contributions we're dealing actively.
